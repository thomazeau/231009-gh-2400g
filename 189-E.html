      <span class="question">Have you ever lived this special moment, your young child not only stands up, but takes their very first steps?</span><br>
      <button class="btn-slide" disabled type="button">189-01</button><br>
      For you who are parents, an unforgettable moment<br>
      But think about this.....<br>
      <span class="question">Which father or mother when seeing their child take their first steps would let go and say, "You're on your own now!"?</span><br>
      No. <button class="btn-slide" disabled type="button">189-02</button><br>
      The parent that truly loves their child will stand behind their toddler, tightly holding their hands, progressively supporting and guiding them as the child matures<br>
      Yes, walking is an important action in our life - mobility<br>
      <span class="tag">metaphor = word picture</span> <button class="btn-slide fade" disabled type="button">189-03</button><br>
      The Bible often uses the <span class="bold">metaphor of walking</span> to describe <span class="bold">our journey through life</span>&nbsp;<br><br>
      <span class="bold">ex/ Enoch</span><br>
      Gen 5:24 Despite the violent world he lived in, <span class="verse">"Enoch kept walking with the true God."</span> "violence-reaction plan = faith (RA2021 Symposium Friday Afternoon - Gangs rob a neighborhood. A father wants to protect his family. Knows that he is the only one in the neighborhood without a gun to protect himself. Wonders how can he protect his family.)<br>
            <span class="question">What difference can be seen between that man of faith and little toddlers?</span><br>
      Adult, had great freedom, and yet he <span class="bold">choose to seek God's help</span>, almost as if he reached out to grab God's hand, seeking his help and guidance <br>

      <span class="tag">us</span><br>

      <span class="question">When confronted with important decisions, do you say, "I'm big enough. I know what I'm doing. I don't need to hold anyone's hand"?</span> <br>
      That is a dangerous attitude. Why? There is a truth we can not deny<br>
      <div class="bible">
      <span class="verse">Jeremiah 10:23</span> I well know, O Jehovah, that man’s way does not belong to him. It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step. </div>

      <span class="tag">3 questions:</span><br>
      <span class="question">In these "critical times hard to deal with", how can we <span class="bold">maintain proper balance</span> between using our freedom, yet at the same time look to&nbsp;God for guidance?</span><br>

      <span class="verse">Gen. 6:9</span> This is the history of Noah. Noah was a righteous man. He proved himself faultless among his contemporaries. Noah walked with the true God.</div>

        "Noah <span class="bold">obeyed his God so closely</span> and <span class="bold">loved him so dearly</span> that it was as if he and Jehovah walked together as friends." &nbsp; - <em>Imatate Their Faith</em> ia p. 17 pp3 </div>
      <span class="question">What do you think? Was Noah's decision a good one? Was it worth it?</span> <button class="btn-slide" disabled type="button">189-08</button><br>
      Walking with God kept him and his family safe in that wicked generation<br>
      They all survived the flood, and thanks to them we are alive today<br>
      Yes, walking with God was <span class="bold">Noah's way of life</span>.<br>
      And it can be the same for us too.<br><br>
      <span class="question">Did you know that Jehovah invites us to walk with him today?</span><br>

      <span class="verse">Micah 4:1,&nbsp;2 </span> In the <span class="bold">final part of the days</span>, the mountain of the house of Jehovah will become firmly established above the top of the mountains, And it will be raised up above the hills, And to it peoples will stream. 2 And many nations will go and say: “Come, let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah and to the house of the God of Jacob. He will instruct us about his ways, <span class="bold">and we will walk in his paths</span>.” For law will go out of Zion, and the word of Jehovah out of Jerusalem.</div>

        <br>
        Young man raised in a poor neighbourhood of Havana, wanted to rebel against the political system in his land<br>
        One day with a classmate, they attacked a police officer to steal his gun. The policeman was badly injured in the head.<br>
        They were put in prison and condemned to death by firing squad. Only 20 years old.<br>
        <br>
        Raudel states: <span style="font-style: italic;">" In the loneliness of my prison cell, I wondered: ‘Why is there so much injustice in the world? Is this life all there is?’</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
        <span style="font-style: italic;">It was at this point that I met some of Jehovah’s Witnesses, who were in prison for their religious beliefs. I was impressed by the Witnesses’ courageous yet peaceable behaviour. Though wrongly imprisoned,
        they were not angry or bitter. I decided to read the Bible on my own. When I finished, I realized that Jehovah’s Witnesses are the only people who behave like the early Christians."</span><br>
        <br style="font-style: italic;">
        Raudel began studying the Bible, but realized that he&nbsp;needed to make some drastic changes in his life. He&nbsp;cleaned up his speech,&nbsp;quit smoking and&nbsp;stopped taking sides on political issues.<br>
        <span style="font-style: italic;">"One of the hardest changes was learning to control my temper. I still pray for self-control in this regard. I have been greatly helped by such Bible verses as</span> <span class="verse"
             style="font-style: italic;">Proverbs 16:32</span><span style="font-style: italic;">, which says:</span> <span class="verse"
             style="font-style: italic;">“The one slow to anger is better than a mighty man, And the one controlling his temper than one conquering a city."</span><br>
        Listening to that&nbsp;one verse changed his life. Raudel was baptized as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses in a barrel of water in the prison.<br>
        <br>
        He says: <span style="font-style: italic;">"I am a happy man, serving God along with my wife and our daughters. Sometimes I think back to that young man who was about to die, and I appreciate how much I have gained since then.</span>
        
      </div>
      Raudel chose to walk in the truth, and is a happy man because of that.

      <div class="experience">
        A young girl, <span class="bold">Maluge, 14</span>, wanted to study the Bible with JW's<br>
        Her <span class="bold">father opposed to the study</span><br>
        Each week, she would hide and was able to study without her father knowing<br>
        When final exams of the school year were near, her father promised her that if she succeeded well on the exams, he would give her a gift<br>
        She passed the exams with flying colours, so she went to her Dad to tell him the news<br>
        <span class="bold">Her father asked her what she would like as a gift.</span>&nbsp; He thought she would ask for a mobile phone, a new dress, a new pair of shoes, etc.<br>
        Maluge asked her father, <span class="bold">“Please let me attend the meetings of JW's”</span><br>
        Her <span class="bold">father was upset</span>, and said that he <span class="bold">would not let her go</span>.<br>
        <span class="question">What did Maluge then do?</span><br>
        She wrote a message to her father that touched his heart.<br>
        In the letter she said: <span style="font-style: italic;">“Jesus predicted that a man’s enemies will be those of his own household. (Mt 10:26).&nbsp;</span> <span class="question"
             style="font-style: italic;">Why is it that I have to endure such great persecution from the person that I love the most?</span><span style="font-style: italic;">”</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
        After her father read the letter, he told her, <span class="bold">“You can go to your meetings. You can go to your Jehovah”.</span><br>
        Maluge began attending all meetings at the Kingdom Hall from that time on.&nbsp;<br>
        In <span class="bold">July 2010</span>, she was able to attend her <span class="bold">first District Convention</span> where she was baptized.<br>
